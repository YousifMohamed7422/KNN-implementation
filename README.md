Iris Dataset Classification using KNN
Project Overview

This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flower species using the famous Iris dataset.


The dataset (iris.csv) contains 150 samples divided into three species:

Iris setosa
Iris versicolor
Iris virginica


**Each sample includes four numerical features:**

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)


The objective of this project is to build a classification model and evaluate its performance using standard machine learning metrics.


Project Tasks
1. Data Loading
Load the dataset (iris.csv) into Python using Jupyter Notebook.
Explore and inspect the dataset structure.

2. Model Building
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

3. Model Evaluation
The following evaluation metrics were calculated:
* Confusion Matrix
* Accuracy
* Precision
* F1 Score
* Error Rate

Sensitivity (Recall)

4. ROC Curve

Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Analyze model performance using ROC analysis.

**Technologies Used :**

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Jupyter Notebook


**Learning Outcomes :**


Understanding classification using KNN
Evaluating model performance using multiple metrics
Interpreting confusion matrix results
Visualizing performance using ROC curves


This project is developed for educational purposes to practice supervised machine learning and model evaluation techniques.
